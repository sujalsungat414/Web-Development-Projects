# Simple Notes App

This is a beginner-level Notes App built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows you to add, view, and delete notes in your browser. Notes are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they persist between sessions on the same device.

## Features

- Add notes with an optional title and note content
- View all saved notes below the input form
- Delete individual notes
- Responsive and clean user interface
- Uses localStorage for persistence without backend

## Usage

Simply open the `notes-app.html` file in any modern web browser.  
Enter a title and note content, then click "Add Note" to save.  
Notes appear below the form and can be deleted by clicking the red "×" button.
